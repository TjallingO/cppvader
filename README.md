# cppvader
This is a single-header C++ port of the [Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment) sentiment analysis tool, written in Python. At this stage, it should be considered a work-in-progress. More specifically:

1. It compiles.
2. It analyses sentences, however:
  - The results do not always match those of the original tool.
  - The syntax, naming and construction match those of the original tool very closely.
    - This implies that the format of this code differs from established C++ best practices.

## Minimal working example
```c++
#include "include/cppvader.hpp"

int main()
{
  vader::SentimentIntensityAnalyser analyser;
  const std::vector<std::string> sentences = 
  {
    "VADER is smart, handsome, and funny.", // positive sentence example
    "VADER is smart, handsome, and funny!", // punctuation emphasis handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)
    "VADER is very smart, handsome, and funny.",  // booster words handled correctly (sentiment intensity adjusted)
    "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY.",   // emphasis for ALLCAPS handled
    "VADER is VERY SMART, handsome, and FUNNY!!!",  // combination of signals - VADER appropriately adjusts intensity
    "VADER is VERY SMART, uber handsome, and FRIGGIN FUNNY!!!",  // booster words & punctuation make this close to ceiling for score
    "VADER is not smart, handsome, nor funny.",  // negation sentence example
    "The book was good.",  // positive sentence
    "At least it isn't a horrible book.",  // negated negative sentence with contraction
    "The book was only kind of good.",  // qualified positive sentence is handled correctly (intensity adjusted)
    "The plot was good, but the characters are uncompelling and the dialog is not great.",  // mixed negation sentence
    "Today SUX!",  // negative slang with capitalization emphasis
    "Today only kinda sux! But I'll get by, lol",  // mixed sentiment example with slang and constrastive conjunction "but"
    "Make sure you :) or :D today!",  // emoticons handled
    "Catch utf-8 emoji such as üíò and üíã and üòÅ",  // emojis handled
    "Not bad at all"  // Capitalized negation
  };

  for (auto &sentence : sentences)
  {
    std::cout.width(80);
    std::cout << sentence << "\t\t" << std::right << analyser.polarityScores(sentence);
  }
}
```

Output:
